## Usage

### Summarizing a YouTube Video

---
```

#### Player Controls
- Play/Pause: Click the play button or use the space key
- Seek Forward/Backward: Use arrow buttons or keyboard shortcuts
- Speed Control: Adjust playback speed with the controls
- Full Screen: Click the expand button

#### Working with Timestamps

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- **Space**: Play/Pause video

- **Down Arrow**: Decrease playback speed
- **T**: Insert timestamp at current position (when enabled)
- **Esc**: Exit fullscreen mode

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **No summary generated**:
   - Verify your API key is correct
   - Check if the video has captions available
   - Enable multimodal analysis for videos without captions

2. **Player not appearing**:
   - Ensure the note has a `media_link` in the frontmatter
   - Verify the URL is a valid YouTube link

3. **Slow summaries**:
   - Long videos may take more time to process
   - Consider using a model with faster inference time

4. **Mini player not responding**:
   - Try closing and reopening the mini player
   - Check that keyboard shortcuts are enabled in settings

### Performance Optimization
- Enable "Unload hidden players" in settings to reduce resource usage
- Use cache settings to optimize repeated video analyses
- Close mini player when not in use
